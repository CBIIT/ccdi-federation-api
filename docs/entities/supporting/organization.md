# Organizations

Organizations are self-reported, non-authoritative descriptions of organizations
that are sharing data through an API endpoint. There is no formal definition or
criteria for what constitutes an organization in this context. Some examples of
what an organization might represent include (but are not limited to) for-profit
companies, non-profit organizations, consortiums, informal bodies, or any
combination of these concepts.

For more information, take a look at the relevant
[API
calls](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-federation-api/specification.html#tag/organization)
and
[models](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-federation-api/specification.html#model/modelsorganization).
