# Namespaces

Namespaces represent top-level governance groupings of primary entities within
the CCDI Federation API. Each namespace is owned by an existing organization
entity, contains information about the governance unit, and provides information
on how to contact the body that governs this namespace.

For more information, take a look at the relevant
[API
calls](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-federation-api/specification.html#tag/namespace)
and
[models](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-federation-api/specification.html#model/modelsnamespace).
