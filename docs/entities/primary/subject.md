# Subjects

**Subjects** represent a persistent, top-level entity under which data in
the API is organized. Generally speaking, subjects are individuals from which
data was collected (i.e., participants). That said, the term "subject" was
specifically chosen to encapsulate other types of entities, such as
patient-derived xenografts, cell lines, and organoids.
