# Files

**Files** represent individual data files associated with one or more samples.
Common file types include unaligned reads (`FASTQ`), aligned reads
(`BAM`/`CRAM`), and variant calling files (`VCF`/`gVCF`). Several other [file
types](https://github.com/CBIIT/ccdi-federation-api/wiki/File-Metadata-Fields#type)
are supported and are documented in more detail at each source server.

For more information, take a look at the relevant
[API
calls](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-federation-api/specification.html#tag/file)
and
[models](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-federation-api/specification.html#model/modelsfile).
