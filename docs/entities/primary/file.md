# Files

**Files** represent individual data files associated with one or more samples.
Common file types include unaligned reads (`FASTQ`), aligned reads
(`BAM`/`CRAM`), and variant calling files (`VCF`/`gVCF`). Several other file
types are supported and are documented in more detail at each source server.
