Welcome to the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) Federation API
documentation ðŸ“š.

The goal of the CCDI Federation API is to support the discovery of real-time,
federated research data made available by the broader pediatric cancer research
community. Here, you'll find documentation regarding the import concepts
necessary to work with the API alongside the specification itself. If you have
any questions, please [create a
discussion](https://github.com/CBIIT/ccdi-federation-api/discussions/categories/q-a).
