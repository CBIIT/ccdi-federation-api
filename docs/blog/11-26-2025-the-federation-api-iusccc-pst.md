We're pleased to spotlight the newest addition to the CCDI Data
Federation: The Indiana Pediatric Solid Tumor program at the Indiana
University Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center (IUSCCC).

**About The IUSCCC Pediatric Solid Tumor Program**

The Sarcoma and Solid Tumor Program at Riley Children's Health, operated
through the Indiana University Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center,
specializes in diagnosing, treating, and researching childhood solid
tumors - including sarcomas and kidney tumors. Through advanced care
protocols and collaborative research with the Children’s Oncology

The CCDI Federation Resource ecosystem allows users to directly access
individual source nodes (and the Pediatric Solid Tumor program data) or
use the aggregation capabilities of the Federation Resource to query
data across all nodes simultaneously. Researchers can leverage this new
Data Federation member, along with the current CCDI Data Federation
Members (KidsFirst, PCDC, St. Jude Cloud, Treehouse, CCDI ecDNA) as
