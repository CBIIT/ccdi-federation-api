Matches are case-sensitive. * When the metadata field is `null` (in the case of singlular or multiple-valued metadata fields) or empty, the subject is not included. * When multiple fields are provided as filters, a logical AND (`&&`) strings together the predicates. In other words, all filters must match for a subject to be returned.

     * @description Gets the files known by this server. ### Pagination This endpoint is paginated. Users may override the default pagination parameters by providing one or more of the pagination-related query parameters below. ### Filtering All harmonized (top-level) and unharmonized (nested under the `metadata.unharmonized` key) metadata fields are filterable. To achieve this, you can provide the field name as a [`String`]. Filtering follows the following rules: * For single-value metadata field, the file is included in the results if its value _exactly_ matches the query string. Matches are case-sensitive. * For multiple-value metadata fields, the file is included in the results if any of its values for the field _exactly_ match the query string (a logical OR [`||`]). Matches are case-sensitive. * When the metadata field is `null` (in the case of singlular or multiple-valued metadata fields) or empty, the file is not included. * When multiple fields are provided as filters, a logical AND (`&&`) strings together the predicates. In other words, all filters must match for a file to be returned. Note that this means that servers do not natively support logical OR (`||`) across multiple fields: that must be done by calling this endpoint with each of your desired queries and performing a set union of those files out of band. ### Ordering This endpoint has default ordering requirementsâ€”those details are documented in the `responses::Files` schema.
