        ### Pagination

        This endpoint is paginated. Users may override the default pagination
        parameters by providing one or more of the pagination-related query
        parameters below.

        ### Filtering

        All harmonized (top-level) and unharmonized (nested under the
        `metadata.unharmonized` key) metadata fields are filterable. To achieve
        this, you can provide the field name as a [`String`]. Filtering follows the
        following rules:

        * For single-value metadata field, the subject is included in the results if
        its value _exactly_ matches the query string. Matches are case-sensitive.
        * For multiple-value metadata fields, the subject is included in the results
        if any of its values for the field _exactly_ match the query string (a
        logical OR [`||`]). Matches are case-sensitive.
        * When the metadata field is `null` (in the case of singlular or
        multiple-valued metadata fields) or empty, the subject is not included.
        * When multiple fields are provided as filters, a logical AND (`&&`) strings
        together the predicates. In other words, all filters must match for a
        subject to be returned. Note that this means that servers do not natively
        support logical OR (`||`) across multiple fields: that must be done by
        calling this endpoint with each of your desired queries and performing a
        set union of those subjects out of band.

        ### Ordering

        This endpoint has default ordering requirements—those details are documented
        in the `responses::Subjects` schema.

          All unharmonized fields should be filterable in the same manner as harmonized fields:

          * Filtering on a singular field should include the `Subject` in the results if the query exactly matches the value of that field for the `Subject` (case-sensitive).
          * Filtering on field with multiple values should include the `Subject` in the results if the query exactly matches any of the values of the field for that `Subject` (case-sensitive).
          * Unlike harmonized fields, unharmonized fields must be prefixed with `metadata.unharmonized`.

          **Note:** this query parameter is intended to be symbolic of any unharmonized field. Because of limitations within Swagger UI, it will show up as a query parameter that can be optionally be submitted as part of a request within Swagger UI.

        ### Pagination

        This endpoint is paginated. Users may override the default pagination
        parameters by providing one or more of the pagination-related query
        parameters below.

        ### Filtering

        All harmonized (top-level) and unharmonized (nested under the
        `metadata.unharmonized` key) metadata fields are filterable. To achieve
        this, you can provide the field name as a [`String`]. Filtering follows the
        following rules:

        * For single-value metadata field, the file is included in the results if
        its value _exactly_ matches the query string. Matches are case-sensitive.
        * For multiple-value metadata fields, the file is included in the results
        if any of its values for the field _exactly_ match the query string (a
        logical OR [`||`]). Matches are case-sensitive.
        * When the metadata field is `null` (in the case of singlular or
        multiple-valued metadata fields) or empty, the file is not included.
        * When multiple fields are provided as filters, a logical AND (`&&`) strings
        together the predicates. In other words, all filters must match for a
        file to be returned. Note that this means that servers do not natively
        support logical OR (`||`) across multiple fields: that must be done by
        calling this endpoint with each of your desired queries and performing a
        set union of those files out of band.

        ### Ordering

        This endpoint has default ordering requirements—those details are documented
        in the `responses::Files` schema.

          the string provided.

          **Note:** a logical OR (`||`) is performed across the values when
          determining whether the sample should be included in the results.

        in: query
        description: |-
          All unharmonized fields should be filterable in the same manner as harmonized fields:

          * Filtering on a singular field should include the `File` in the results if the query exactly matches the value of that field for the `File` (case-sensitive).
          * Filtering on field with multiple values should include the `File` in the results if the query exactly matches any of the values of the field for that `File` (case-sensitive).
          * Unlike harmonized fields, unharmonized fields must be prefixed with `metadata.unharmonized`.

          **Note:** this query parameter is intended to be symbolic of any unharmonized field. Because of limitations within Swagger UI, it will show up as a query parameter that can be optionally be submitted as part of a request within Swagger UI. Please keep in mind that the literal query parameter `?metadata.unharmonized.<field>=value` is not supported, so attempting to use it within Swagger UI will not work!

Though not required, we recommend an all lowercase name of `link` for this response header."

            Gateways can be either [anonymous](AnonymousOrReference::Anonymous)

            [refererence](AnonymousOrReference::Reference) to a [named
            gateway](gateway::Named) ([gateways](crate::Gateway) with a name).

            **Anonymous** gateways are intended to be embedded directly within a
            returned file in the `/file` response object. They have no name and are
            only referred to by the file within which they are embedded.

            **Named** gateways, on the other hand, are included in the `gateways`
            key in the `/file` response object and referred to by name within a
            returned file in the `/file` response object. They are intended to be
            used when more than one file references the same gateway. This mechanism
            is available to ensure that the gateway object does not need to be
            duplicated multiple times in the response in these cases.

            This field can contain multiple gateways to support scenarios where a
            file is available through more than one mechanism. We expect that only
            one gateway will be returned in most responses.

            **Note:** a file must have at least one gateway. If the file has no
            gateway, then it should not be returned as part of this API.

          Note that, if authorization is not explicitly granted by some entity
          controlling the resource, OR if authorization is given to _all_
          authenticated individuals, then a [`Gateway::Registered`] should be used
          instead.

              A Markdown field (formatted according to the [CommonMark] standard) that
              describes the gateway.

              At a minimum, a description of what the gateway is and why it is closed
              is recommended.

              **Note:** this field is required for a closed gateway. This was an
              intentional decision: gateways are intended to point users to external
              resources. When that is not possible, a gateway's only purpose can be to
              provide further information about the data source. Put another way, if
              one is attempting to construct a closed gateway with no description, it
              should be considered why a gateway is needed at all.

          A link that points precisely to the desired resource.

          [`Link::Direct`] is used when the resource pointed to by the URL
          exactly matches the desired content—no more and no less.

          For example, if a user wants the RNA-Seq BAM files for a particular
          sample and the source server can provide a link that filters down to
          only those files using query parameters, [`Link::Direct`] should be
          used.

          A link that points _approximately_ to the desired resource.

          [`Link::Approximate`] is used when an direct link to a desired resource
          cannot be constructed by the server, but a link to _approximately_ the
          desired resource followed by following some manual instructions will
          deliver the desired resources.

          For example, if a user wants the RNA-Seq BAM files for a particular
          sample, but the server can only construct a link to the particular
          sample and file type and/or sequencing type must be filtered manually in
          the user interface, then a [`Link::Approximate`] should be constructed
          with (a) the `url` field pointing to the sample link and (b) the
          `instructions` field telling the end user how to filter to their desired
          content within the user interface.

            description: |-
              The manual instructions to follow after navigating to the URL.

              As much as is practical, instructions should be as specific as
              possible to the desired data. We expect that generating dynamic
              instructions based on the user's selection will require a
              non-trivial amount of development effort rather than returning
              generic set of instructions. The reason for this is because this
              field is intended to be surfaced as tailored instructions with a
              user interface detailing to the user _exactly_ how to retrieve their
              desired data.

              For example, if a user is requesting whole-genome sequence BAM files
              for a particular sample but the server can only construct a link to
              _all_ files for the sample, the instructions should specify how to
              filter down to only the whole-genome sequence BAM files
              specifically—not how to operate filters within the interface
              generally.

          A link that points to information about how to retrieve the desired
          resource.

          [`Link::Informational`] is used when a link to the desired content
          cannot be constructed by the server, but a link describing how to gain
          access to the resource is known. This [`Link`] is reserved for
          situations where the data is not accessible except via an out-of-band
          process—if the resource can be reached (not necessarily accessed) by
          following a URL and a subsequent set of instructions, a
          [`Link::Approximate`] should be used instead.

          For example, if a request form exists where, once approved, some data is
          sent to the user in a manual fashion, then a [`Link::Informational`]
          should be used (the distinguishing factor being that the user cannot
          complete the request process without some out-of-band or manual
          process).

          **Note:** no further informational field is provided within the API
          because the expectation is that the information on what steps should be
          taken next will be available at the specified URL.

      description: |-
        A link to an external resource.

        A link communicates information about where a resource is located, alongside
        additional context regarding how the link should be interpreted (via the
        `kind` field). All [`Link`]s include a `url` field pointing to the external
        resource. In the case of [`Link::Approximate`] and [`Link::MailTo`], a
        required `instructions` field is included to instruct the user of what steps
        to take after the link has been followed (see the definition of
        [`Link::Approximate`] and [`Link::MailTo`] for more details, respectively).

        **Note:** the context of what resources are desired compared with what
        resources the link represents is an important consideration when
        constructing the correct [`Link`]. For example, if the desired resource is a
        specific file, but the server can only construct a link to a cohort of
        files, a [`Link::Approximate`] should be used. In contrast, if the desired
        resource is the entire cohort of files, a [`Link::Direct`] should be used.

        **Note:** the link does not imply the access level or immediate availability
        of the data—it only points a user to where they can _attempt_ to access the
        data. Instead, [`Link`]s are always wrapped in a [`Gateway`](super::Gateway)
        that communicates the access level or requirements. In other words, a
        [`Link`] can absolutely require authentication or authorization before data
        becomes accessible (and the corresponding [`Gateway`](super::Gateway) within
        which the [`Link`] is embedded should reflect this).

        ## Examples

        * If the data is contained within a file where a direct link can be
        constructed, whether that file is open access or controlled, then a
        [`Link::Direct`] should be constructed with a link directly to that file.
        * In the event that study data is deposited as a study within a larger data
        repository, such as the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) or
        the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA), and the `url` points to the
        study page:
        * If the desired resource is a specific file or subset of (but not all)
        files within the study, a [`Link::Approximate`] should be returned.
        This is because the link includes more files than what was
        specifically requested—thus, instructions on how to filter to the
        files requested must be communicated.
        * If the desired resource is _every_ file in the study, then a
        [`Link::Direct`] should be returned pointing to the study page.
        * If the data is not immediately requestable through a webpage but there
        exists an informational page on how to request the data using an
        out-of-band process, then a [`Link::Informational`] should be used.
        * If the data is available after contacting an email address, then a
        [`Link::MailTo`] should be used.

        A named gateway is simply a [`Gateway`] with a name. Named gateways exist so

        **Note:** a _named_ gateway can only be included in a `gateways` response

              instance. This is necessary, since a namespace can be tied to one and
              only one organization in the API specification. As such, if the above is

        This field is intended to be the proper name of the organization that mints
        identifiers within a given namespace. That said, we have intentionally not
        required that this be an organization specifically, as there may be exceptions
        to this guideline. We recommend that you use an organization name here if you
        can, but you may put whatever value is appropriate to describe the owner of the
        namespace.

        It is recommended that you use title case for this field, though that is not
        required.

        **Note:** this field is asserted by the source server, but it is not guaranteed
        to be authoritative across the federation (due to the decentralized nature of

        A response representing multiple samples known about by the server.

        When no sort order is provided, samples **must** be ordered by the primary
        identifier. This means that, when comparing two identifiers:

        1. The namespace organization field should be sorted alphabetically. If all
        values for the namespace organization are equal, continue on to the next
        sorting criteria.
        2. The namespace name field should be sorted alphabetically. If all values
        for the namespace names are equal, continue on to the next sorting
        criteria.
        3. The entity name should be sorted alphabetically.

        Since the `namespace` and `name` identifiers should always uniquely apply to
        a single entity, this should always resolve to an ordering.

        If there is a provided sort order, use that instead.

            This is a free-text field describing the name of this server, if it has

            Though there is explicitly no versioning dictated by the specification,
            we recommend [Semantic Versioning v2.0](https://semver.org/) in the
            absence of better options to align with the scheme used by the API. Note
            that using the same versioning scheme does not mean that the version of
            your server is recommended to be the same version as the API.

            This field is intended to be the proper name of the organization that
            owns and operates the server. That said, we have intentionally not
            required this restriction, as there may be exceptions to this guideline.
            We recommend that you use an organization name here if you can, but you
            may put whatever value is appropriate to describe the owner of the
            server.

            It is recommended that you use title case for this field, though that is
            not strictly required.
