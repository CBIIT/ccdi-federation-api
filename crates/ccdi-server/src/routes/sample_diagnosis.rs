/// Experimental: Filter the samples known by this server by free-text diagnosis search.
///
/// ### Diagnosis Filtering
///
/// This endpoint supports the experimental `search` parameter.
/// For this parameter, the sample is included in the results if the value of its
/// its `diagnosis` field _contains_ the query string, or if an unharmonized field
/// treated by the implementer as a diagnosis field contains that query string.
/// Matches are case-insensitive.
///
/// ### Pagination
///
/// This endpoint is paginated. Users may override the default pagination
/// parameters by providing one or more of the pagination-related query
/// parameters below.
///
/// ### Additional Filtering
///
/// All harmonized (top-level) and unharmonized (nested under the
/// `metadata.unharmonized` key) metadata fields are filterable. To achieve
/// this, you can provide the field name as a [`String`]. Filtering follows the
/// following rules:
///
/// * For single-value metadata field, the sample is included in the results if
///   its value _exactly_ matches the query string. Matches are case-sensitive.
/// * For multiple-value metadata fields, the sample is included in the results
///   if any of its values for the field _exactly_ match the query string (a
///   logical OR [`||`]). Matches are case-sensitive.
/// * When the metadata field is `null` (in the case of singular or
///   multiple-valued metadata fields) or empty, the sample is not included.
/// * When multiple fields are provided as filters, a logical AND (`&&`) strings
///   together the predicates. In other words, all filters must match for a
///   sample to be returned. Note that this means that servers do not natively
///   support logical OR (`||`) across multiple fields: that must be done by
///   calling this endpoint with each of your desired queries and performing a
///   set union of those samples out of band.
///
/// ### Ordering
///
/// This endpoint has default ordering requirementsâ€”those details are documented
/// in the `responses::Samples` schema.
///
/// Note: This API is experimental and is subject to change without being considered
/// as a breaking change.

            `?metadata.unharmonized.<field>=value` is not supported, so \
            attempting to use it within Swagger UI will not work!"

                    when paging through paginated responses. This header \
                    contains two or more links of interest. The format of the \
                    field is as follows: \
                    \n\
                    \n`Link: <URL>; rel=\"REL\"` \
                    \n\
                    ### Relationships\n\n\
                    In the format above, `URL` represents a valid URL for \
                    the link of interest and `REL` is one of four values: \n\
                    - `first` (_Required_). A link to the first page in the \
                    results (can be the same as `last` if there is only one \
                    page).\n\
                    - `last` (_Required_). A link to the first page in the \
                    results (can be the same as `first` if there is only one \
                    page).\n\
                    - `next` (_Optional_). A link to the next page (if it \
                    exists).\n\
                    - `prev` (_Optional_). A link to the previous page (if it \
                    exists).\n\n\
                    ### Requirements\n\n\
                    - This header _must_ provide links for at least the `first` \
                    and `last` rels.\n \
                    - The `prev` and `next` links must exist only (a) when there \
                    are multiple pages in the result page set and (b) when the \
                    current page is not the first or last page, respectively.\n\
                    - This list of links is unordered.\n\n \
                    ### Notes\n\n\
                    - HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2.0 dictate that response \
                    headers are case insensitive. Though not required, we \
                    recommend an all lowercase name of `link` for this \
                    response header."
